      <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Mainly I am developing single page applications with emphasis on front-end development but I also have experience developing back-end services using node.js.</p>   
<p>I have 11 years of experience in web development. In early days I had started as "classical full stack developer" working mostly in PHP and MySQL (LAMP environment with Codeigniter or Laravel later on) but as web industry evolved I stayed with javascript and now I am using it for developing web apps, mobile apps (React Native or Phonegap) and desktop apps (electron).</p>
<p>I have developed a fair amount of large and complex applications working in small and large teams and I learned (sometimes in a hard and expensive ways) that these applications must be written using isolated and testable modules so that even interns with limited experience can write plugins without having to know all about the inner work of the application.</p>
<p>Since javascript world tends to change, so does my workflow... Currently, my repositories have webpack.config.js and .babelrc where everything is written in ES6+ style. All my scripts are required in commonJS style and my functions are tested. Usually, my programs end up writing to the DOM using React where components are communicating with each other with redux. As for my latest projects, react/redux is changed in favor of RxJS and cycle.js  
<p>I am specialized in:<br>
  - Javascript / Node.js  <br>
  - ES6 / ES7 / webpack / babel <br>
  - React / JSX / redux <br>
  - RxJS / cycle.js <br>
  - Electron <br>
 </p>
<p> I have experience in: <br>
 - PHP  <br>
 - Wordpress / CSS / HTML <br>
 - C  <br>
 - Microcontrollers <br>
 - Assembler  <br>

<p>Education: Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering</p>
